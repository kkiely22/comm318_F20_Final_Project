## FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS AND OBESITY IN AMERICA DATA STORY

My data story is about fast food as a cause of obesity in America. Obesity in America has become a severe issue and I feel that it is necessary to show people that fast food restaurants have been a large contributor to the obesity epidemic. I created by data story to be like a data journalism article for the general audience. I would love for this article to catch the attention of people who eat fast food often. Bringing attention to fast food restaurants as a factor of obesity in America can hopefully reverse or even slow the rise of obesity and decline of health in America. 

My data story can be found in the `Final_Project_Fast_Food_and_Obesity.ipynb` notebook and in Markdown in `Final_Project_Fast_Food_and_Obesity.md`. 

In my data_story_presentation folder you will also find graphs that I created from data that I found as well as some Google photos that add visual appeal to my data story.
