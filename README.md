## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

### In this project I explored the question: Is fast food driving the obesity epidemic in America?
I decided to choose this question because I recently noticed how severe the obesity problem has gotten to be in America. I recognized that there are many factors contributing to this problem, but I wanted to focus on just one. Because fast food restaurants are a large part of American culture, I wanted to delve deeper into how it has effected our society. 

My data looked at the years 2014-2016. My data primarily looked at fast food restaurants across America and obesity rates across America. Within my notebooks, I came up with sub questions to answer my research question. With this data, I created 2 maps: a map to show fast food restaurants per capita and a map to show obesity rates across America. In addition to creating 2 visual maps, I researched factors of obesity such as gender, income, and obesity. I found additional data with factors of fast food comsumption such as gender, income, and age in order to see if there is a relationship between obesity and fast food consumption. In addition to factors such as gender, income, and age, I looked at factors such as taste, cost, and convenience that make fast food so appealing and popular in America.

The purpose of my data story is to show the association between fast food and obesity based on different factors. 
My data story focuses on why fast food is so popular in America, who eats it the most and how fast food has had a negative effect on society. I answered these questions by focusing on the taste, cost, and convenience of fast food as well as statistics about gender, income, and age for understanding who consumes fast food the most and who is the most obese in America.

I found that, while fast food may not be the sole factor driving the obesity epidemic in America, it plays a large role in obesity in America. As the fast food industry continues to grow, it will be increasingly difficult to reverse or even slow the rise of obesity and decline of health in America.
